# FDService-Examples

## This repo will have sample code for using/extending the Fonteva Services platform.

### [Payment Engine](PaymentEngine_README.md)
   This section will outline how to extend/overwrite the Fonteva Payment framework. Many folks have requirements
   beyond what can be be supported out of the box and this engine will allow developers to fulfill that requirement.
   Included in this repo are full code examples that can be directly deployed.

### [Service Examples](ServiceExamples_README.md)
   The Fonteva Services platform ships two types of services and both are outlined with examples. You will be able to learn
   how to extend/overwrite services that are shipped part of the platform.

### [Wrapper Examples](WrapperExamples_README.md)
   All SObjects are wrapped in apex classes to make sure that DML's occur through our services. Examples will show how extend
   wrappers for any custom fields that are added outside of the platform.
   
### [Spark Plugs Examples](SparkPlugs_README.md)
   Spark Plugs allows the ability to provide custom UI inside a Fonteva Platform flow. This can be done seamlessly in 
   multiple locations. Example will show what the Lightning component needs to look like and the CMT (Custom Metadata Type).
