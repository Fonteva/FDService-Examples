# FDService-Examples

## This repo has sample code for using/extending the Fonteva Services platform.

### [Payment Engine](PaymentEngine_README.md)
   This section outlines how to extend and overwrite the Fonteva Payment framework. Many folks have requirements
   beyond what is incuded in the base product. This engine allows developers to fulfill that requirement.
   Included in this repo are full code examples that can be directly deployed.

### [Service Examples](ServiceExamples_README.md)
   The Fonteva Services platform ships two types of services. Both are outlined with examples here. You will learn
   how to extend and overwrite services that are shipped as part of the platform.

### [Wrapper Examples](WrapperExamples_README.md)
   All SObjects are wrapped in Apex classes to make sure that DMLs occur through our services. Examples show how to extend
   wrappers for any custom fields added outside of the platform.
